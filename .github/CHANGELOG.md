Originally, prosecutor data was housed in a [.JSON masterlist](https://github.com/billimarie/light-pollution/blob/master/public/data/prosecutors.json). I pulled information from there with Handlebars. The agile prototype ran on a simple, clean, and user-friendly GitHub Pages website: [Light Pollution](https://billimarie.github.io/light-pollution).
